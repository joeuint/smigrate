== Building ==
To build, simply use cmake.

```sh
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

== Using ==
All migrations have a specific format. You need to create a directory
called `migrations` relative to your working directory. A migrations
folder should have migrations in the format of
<number>_<name>_.<up/down>.sql where:

number is a 6 digit number padded by 0's (e.g 000067).

name is a human readable identifier only consisting of upper or
lowercase letters or an underline (_).

up/down describes whether the migration applys or reverts transactions.
It can be either up or down. Both are required for all migrations.

A future planned `new` sub command will do this for you.
